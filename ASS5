ASSIGNMENT 1.5:
1)MAIN SOURCES OF DATA FLOOD:
The main sources are
1)The New York stock exchange generates about 4-5 terabytes of data everyday • Facebook hosts more than 240 billion photos,
growing at 7 petabytes of data everyday
2) Ancestory.com, the genealogy site stores
around 10 petabytes of the data
3)The Internet Archive stores around 18.5
petabytes of data
4) The Large Hadron Collider near Geneva
produces about 30 Petabytes of data every year

2)DIFF B/W DATA AND BIG DATA:

DATA:
Data can be defined as a representation of facts, concepts or instructions in a formalized manner which should be suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing by human or electronic machine.

BIG DATA:

Big Data is a high-volume, highvelocity and high-variety information asset that demands cost-effective, innovative forms of information
processing for enhanced insight and decision making.
Big Data is a concept in Software Engineering which we use when we have a large sets of machine generated data, which in most of the cases is unstructured and not easy to use with traditional RDBMS concepts.

3)HADOOP BECOMING THE SOLUTION FOR DATA EXPLOSION:

Hadoop is an open source ,java-based programming framework that supports the processing of large data sets in a distributed computing environment.
Hadoop provides a reliable,Scalable platform for storage and analysis.
It is based on Google File Syatem or GFS.
Hadoop runs a number of applications on distributed systems with thousands of nodes involving petabytes of data.
It has a distributed file system,called the Hadoop Distributed File System or HDFS,which enable fast data transfer among the nodes.
